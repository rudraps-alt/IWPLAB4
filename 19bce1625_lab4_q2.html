        Bermuda triangle, also known as the Devil’s Triangle, happens to be one of the most mysterious places on this
        planet. Located off the Southeastern coast of the US in the Atlantic Ocean, between Bermuda, Florida and Puerto
        Rico, the region has become the Centre of unresolved mysteries. Covering an area of 440,000 miles of sea,
        Bermuda triangle is part of a busy shipping route in the world, with a number of vessels heading to America,
        Europe and the Caribbean crossing through every day.
        It is more due to the inexplicable outcomes that make it a highly studied and yet enigmatic component of earth’s
        surface. Over the centuries, a large number of ships and planes have been reported to have mysteriously
        disappeared in the region. Also, this Devil’s Triangle has been blamed for the disappearance of thousands of
        people in the past decades. The term “Bermuda Triangle” was first used by Vincent Gaddis in 1964 in his article
        published in Argosy magazine.
        The stories around Bermuda triangle begins in the time of Christopher Columbus when he reportedly saw a flame of
        fire crashing into the sea in the triangle during his first voyage to the New World. However, the mysterious
        behaviour of the region came into the public attention only in the 20th century when the Navy cargo ship, USS
        Cyclops, with more than 300 people onboard, went missing in the Bermuda triangle. The latest such incident in
        the region is the disappearance of a small twin-engine plane in May this year. The plane, with four people on
        board, suddenly disappeared from the radar when it was flying from Puerto Rico to Florida, and the debris
        appeared to be from the missing plane was found later. The recent incident that involved a ship was the sinking
        of a cargo vessel in the Bermuda Triangle during a deadly hurricane in October 2015.
        As the accidents, often mysterious, continue to happen in the Bermuda Triangle region, many have offered a
        number of explanations for the mystery behind them. The role of paranormal activities and the presence of aliens
        have been strongly suggested by those who believe something odd is happening, while many with scientific view
        disputed this argument offering rational explanations to the phenomenon. Among the few proposed scientific
        explanation, the more popular is the theory of electromagnetic interference that causes compass problems. This
        theory claims that there is a very high pull of the earth’s natural magnet which redirects the compass and other
        sophisticated equipment, and disallows them to take their intended route through the waters. However, as no
        single theory could offer a concrete explanation, many still believe there is nothing strange with the region as
        most of the incidents were inaccurately reported or fictionalised versions of the accidents.

        Notwithstanding there is no proven theory for the exact reason behind the mystery of Bermuda Triangle, the
        accidents continue to happen in the region every year. And, the legends of Bermuda Triangle consists a number of
        mysterious disappearance of vessels in the region, most of them remain least clueless still. Here is a list of
        most noted stories of disappearance or the unresolved mysteries of ship accidents in the Devil’s Triangle.

        1. Mary Celeste
        Possibly one of the most mysterious stories of shipwrecks, this ship is a tale of its own. Despite being found
        adrift in some other location in the Atlantic Ocean, the connection to the Bermuda triangle had been somehow
        invoked to find an answer to the mystery of its fate.
